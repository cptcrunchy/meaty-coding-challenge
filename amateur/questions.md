1) Write a function that returns the SUM of a sequence of numbers. This sequence
   is determined by three variables: start, finish, and step. The sequence begins
   at start, ends at finish, and goes up by step until it reaches finish or a number
   that when increased by step would go past finish.

   **Example**

   **Input**: start = 1, finish = 4, step = 1
   **Output**: 10

   **Input**: start = 4, finish = 10, step = 5
   **Output**: 13
